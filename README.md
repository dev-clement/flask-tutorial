# flask-tutorial
This project is a simple Flask application written using python3.10 on linux.
This application is made in order to see and learn on how Flask is working and
all the things we can do with it.
## Future
At the end, this application is supposed to be the back-end of a website
that will have the following stack:

* TypeScript (Angular) for the front-end
* Python (Flask) for the back-end

As I am the only developper working on this side-project, I won't make any branch
to work on it. Plus, this project will be pretty easy so I won't go into deep issues
when working on it. Simply because this project is done in order to make working with
Flask a habit (the use of factories, the template through jinja2 and so on...), 
in order to work on a bigger project.
